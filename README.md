       * Overview

       * Business Understanding
          * In the movie business numerous genres and sub genres exist and it is important to realize that not all genres are created equal in terms of business need. Niche genres are less likely to generate significant mass market appeal, while the most popular genres are often saturated by competing movie studios. To this end we decided to use audience reception scores to indicate the best and most popular genres to target. Additionally we examined the runtimes of each genre as each extra minute can add significantly to expenses to refine down further the optimal genre. Furthermore as international markets expand, it is important to examine both the feasibility of domestic and international audiences for Computing Vision. As production centers like Bollywood show, studios can reap great success by primarily targeting international audiences, so we set out to understand the size and attractiveness of these markets by looking at ROI in both markets. Finally, coming back to runtimes we sought to find the runtime with the best ROI as to best understand what lengths customers craved while not pushing past the limited attention spans of busy consumers
